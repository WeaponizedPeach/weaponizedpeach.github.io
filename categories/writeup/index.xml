As is typical, besides just getting the root flag, we will need to answer some questions.
Tasks Task 1: What does the 3-letter acronym SMB stand for? Server Message Block Task 2: What port does SMB use to operate at? 445 Task 3: What network communication model does SMB use, architecturally speaking? Let&amp;rsquo;s Google a bit and find a diagram of the architecture used in SMB: SMB architecture (Source: ionos.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox: Fawn</title><link>https://weaponizedpeach.github.io/p/hackthebox-fawn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 22:02:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://weaponizedpeach.github.io/p/hackthebox-fawn/</guid><description>Intro This is another Very Easy machine from the Starting Point section on HackTheBox.

It is meant to be an introductory box, to fully clear it, in addition to getting flags, we will also need to answer some questions.
Tasks Task 1: What does the acronym VM stand for? Virtual Machine Task 2: What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to start our VPN connection?</description></item><item><title>TryHackMe: Mr Robot CTF</title><link>https://weaponizedpeach.github.io/p/tryhackme-mr-robot-ctf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:50:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://weaponizedpeach.github.io/p/tryhackme-mr-robot-ctf/</guid><description>Intro This time we&amp;rsquo;re breaking a machine from the &amp;ldquo;Mr Robot CTF&amp;rdquo; room over on TryHackMe.
Reconnaissance The room itself on TryHackMe does not give much to go on, apart from the fact that the machine itself is inspired by the show Mr. Robot.
Scanning &amp;amp; Discovery RustScan I decided to use I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a bunch about - RustScan. It pins down open ports much more efficiently, cutting down the amount of time needed for, say, a full port scan on a box.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox: Horizontall</title><link>https://weaponizedpeach.github.io/p/hackthebox-horizontall/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 20:55:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://weaponizedpeach.github.io/p/hackthebox-horizontall/</guid><description>Intro Welcome to my very first writeup! I am just starting out my infosec journey, and this box was my first &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; challenge. Although it is rated &amp;lsquo;Easy&amp;rsquo;, I had to apply all of my current knowledge to snag both flags. Let&amp;rsquo;s crack straight into it!
Reconnaissance Machine tags:
Linux CMS Exploit Outdated Software CVE Injection RCE Account Misconfiguration The tags on the machine alone gives us a pretty good idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be up against.</description></item></channel></rss>
