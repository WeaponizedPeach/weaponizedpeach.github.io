## Intro
This time we're breaking a machine from the "Mr Robot CTF" room [over on TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot). 

## Reconnaissance
The room itself on TryHackMe does not give much to go on, apart from the fact that the machine itself is inspired by the show [Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/).

## Scanning & Discovery

### RustScan
I decided to use I've heard a bunch about - [RustScan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan). It pins down open ports much more efficiently, cutting down the amount of time needed for, say, a full port scan on a box.

For starters, let's go with an initial scan:
```
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

### whatweb
Whatweb did not tell me much, apart that the box is running on some version of Apache.
`http://10.10.111.68 [200 OK] Apache, Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Apache], IP[10.10.111.68], Script, UncommonHeaders[x-mod-pagespeed], X-Frame-Options[SAMEORIGIN]`

### Browser
It seems we have a web server, both HTTP and HTTPS, let's check it out.

While the website itself is very elaborate for a pentesting machine, going along with the 'terminal' didn't really lead me anywhere productive.

There doesn't seem to be a difference functionality-wise whether I accessed it via HTTP or HTTPS. The self-signed SSL certificate file doesn't leak any subdomains.

`/sitemap.xml` doesn't give anything at all.

`/robots.txt` is very promising, however:
![robots.txt](robots.txt.png)

Sure enough, /key-1-of-3.txt leads us to the first key for this CTF: `073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9`
![/key-1-of-3.txt](key1.png)

The `/fsocity.dic` seems to be a dictionary file of sorts, line seperated, one entry per line. Might prove useful later.

Skimming through the source code of the website clues me into that this is actually a Wordpress site, even though it doesn't look like it. Specifically, links to `wp-content` and `https://wordpress.org/`

![WordPress source code](wordpress_source_code.png)

### feroxbuster
Since we now know this is a WordPress site, we know it is a Content Management System (CMS). There should be a dashboard somewhere for content management, which coincidentally (especially on WordPress) often has opportunities for remote code execution (RCE).

Trying to simply go to `/admin` puts us into a redirect loop, not leading us anywhere.

Try to crack open the big guns and do a directory scan with [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster). Similar to RustScan, this tool is also written in Rust. I like how it can scan a list of directories in parallel, making it faster. I used `directory_list-2.3-big` from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

```

We get back a lot of directories. The one that stands out to me the most is http://10.10.172.225/wp-login.php, let's check it out.

### Browser: /wp-login.php (1/2)

Here we get a nice, typical WordPress login page. I will admit I was stuck here for a long time, not knowing how to proceed. the `readme.html` file doesn't leak any info about the WordPress version.

![readme.html](readme.html.png)

Trying to attack the form itself via sqlmap was also unsuccessful.

`[!] 86 vulnerabilities identified`

Now that is a lot. Unfortunately, many required authentication, which we didn't have (yet). Many were focused on XSS, which also isn't super useful for this CTF format. The ones that focused on RCE depended on plugins that this site did not have.

Maybe I was thinking about this too hard.

### Browser: /wp-login.php (2/2)

It's time to come back to the `fsocity.dic` file, given it does look as a possible username & password list. However, given the 7MB size and 858160 entries in this file, trying to both find a viable username AND the password for it would have taken forever.

I did more research about the show (Mr. Robot) the box is based on. I tried out several usernames. Fortunately, WordPress leaks viable usernames, by giving a different prompt if the username exists. `Elliot` is one of them.

![Possible Username](elliot_incorrect_pass.png)

Now that we have a possible username, let's try to determine the password.

### Hydra

With username and wordlist in hand, let's start up Hydra and try to figure out the password:
```
hydra -l Elliot -P ../downloads/fsocity.dic 10.10.111.68 -V http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.111.68%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:S=Location
```

Eventually, we get a hit. Time to login.
```
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.111.68   login: Elliot   password: ER28-0652
```
## Exploitation

### Browser: /wp-login.php (Admin dashboard)
Upon logging in we are greeted with a dashboard.

![Admin Dashboard](admin_panel.png)

The plugins section had a bunch of plugins, but none seemed to have exploitation opportunities. Fortunately, going to `Appearance -> Editor` allows us to edit various page templates. This is a great place to insert some malicious code and possibly get a reverse shell. I hopped onto [RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/) and grabbed a PHP reverse shell script. I inserted it into the "404 Template", as it seemed to easiest to exploit.

![Template Editor](revshell.png)

Let's save it and try to provoke a 404 response.
![404 Template with Reverse Shell saved](revshell_set-up.png)

I set-up my netcat listener and went to a gibberish URL hoping the 404 template would kick in and with it, the reverse shell script.

![User Access](user_access.png)

And it worked!

## Privilege Escalation

### Horizontal Escalation (robot)
Unfortunately, we don't seem to have a lot of permissions to pretty much anything with this user. Let's snoop around the `/home` directory.

![contents of /home/robot](password_hash.png)

Here we found a password hash the second key, to which we don't have access (yet). The `raw-md5` clues us in that this hash is MD5. Let's check [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/), maybe it has already been cracked in the past.

![Crackstation](robot_password_cracked.png)

Fortunately, CrackStation already had an exact match for this hash. We can now login to the `robot` user with the password `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.

![Login with user 'robot'](robot_access_gained.png)

I had issues getting `su` to work, so I just spawned a shell with Python and that got it working.

`robot` access allowed me to read the `key-2-of-3.txt` file that I wasn't able to previously -> `822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959`

### Vertical escalation (root)
It was now time for the final obstacle: the root user.

#### SUID Binaries
I scanned the system for unusual SUID binaries, this is one of the first areas I look for when trying to obtain privilege escalation, as it is one of the easiest and least time consuming to exploit. I prefer to use this one-liner:

```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
![SUID binaries](suid_binaries.png)

Among the results was an nmap binary, in `/usr/local/`, of all places. I checked out [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#suid) section regarding nmap.

![GTFOBins: nmap (SUID)](gtfobins_nmap_suid.png)

Attempting to exploit this misconfiguration proved challenging. However, upon fiddling with the binary, I noticed it was `nmap v.3.81` - a very old one, dating way way back to ***2005***. 

![GTFOBins: nmap (SUDO)](nmap_sudo.png)
Upon closer inspection, this version seemed to be vulnerable to the SUDO exploit mentioned in scenario B of the aforementioned GTFOBins section.

It was time to test this out.

```bash
robot@linux:~$ nmap --interactive
nmap --interactive

Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
nmap> !sh
!sh
# whoami
whoami
root
# cd /root
cd /root
# ls
ls
firstboot_done  key-3-of-3.txt
# cat key-3-of-3.txt
cat key-3-of-3.txt
04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4
# 
```

And just like that, we now both have root access and the last key: `04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4`.

## Outro
Overall, this boxed prove to be pretty balanced difficulty-wise. I mostly have one critique - the over-reliance on the massive dictionary file. The box doesn't handle many connections well, so the password cracking took a considerable amount of time. If I had to enumerate usernames with this wordlist as well, it would have taken even longer.

I would have also liked the front-facing side of the website to lead somewhere, rather than just working as a front/cover. I think using the `robots.txt` file as a callback to the show was somewhat clever.

It was nice to try out a couple of Rust written tools this time.
